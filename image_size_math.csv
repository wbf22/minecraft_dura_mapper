one region file is 1024 chunks,,,
1024 chunks in a region,,,
each chunk has 256 surface blocks,,,
each block has 256 pixels on one side,,,
,,,
so a region would be:,1024*256*256,67108864,pixels
,,,
a typical image is 1920 * 1080,2073600,pixels,
,,,
,,,
so we probaly want to divid regions up,,,
,,,
,,,
SIZE OF REGION SPLIT INTO 4,,,
256*256*256,16777216,pixels,
,,,
SIZE OF REGION SPLIT INTO 8,,,
128*256*256,8388608,pixels,
,,,
SIZE OF REGION SPLIT INTO 16,,,
64*256*256,4194304,pixels,
,,,
SIZE OF REGION SPLIT INTO 32,,,
32*256*256,2097152,pixels,
,,,
SIZE OF REGION SPLIT INTO 64,,,
16*256*256,1048576,pixels,
,,,
,,,
So it looks we want to split a region into 64 pieces. This would 4x4 chunk sections,,,
